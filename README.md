This Solution was created with the intention of having a simple requirement in order to practice the implementation of some interesting concepts like:
    * Clean Architecture
    * Design Patterns 
    * Unit Testing

# Base Business Logic
The requirement for this API is simple:
As a robotic waitress I need a service that returns a drinks menu based on customer Age.
    * Customer younger than 18 years old should only get soft drinks
    * Customer older than 18 years old but younger than 21 should get soft drink but only beers for alcoholic drinks.
    * Customer older than 21 years old should get the full drinks menu
